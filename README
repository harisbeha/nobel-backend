To the programmer coming after me:

This project is a bunch of models with a skeleton of views right now.

The definitive user stories are in user-stories.txt. Everything except for the
automated parts is implemented in custom_apps/invoices/admin_views.

The automated parts have bits and pieces scattered around but aren't all that
hooked together.

The model-admins that are in invoices/admin.py were a previous attempt at writing
this that didn't do very well, but contain a few nuggets about how to interface
with the automated processes and a few tricks to force django to render stuff right.
In this old setting there was a single model `Job` to handle both WorkVisit and
SafetyReport.

Everything that needs to be done is marked as a to-do in the code, with the following
exceptions:

- TODO the building model-admin
- TODO bulk import/export
- TODO the automated processes
- TODO creation of invoices

godspeed. I haven't run any of this code yet so there may be some issues.
