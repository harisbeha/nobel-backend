Starting 5-7 AM, snow began to mix with sleet and rain. By Noon, many areas were seeing mostly rain with just some occasional sleet with temperatures in the mid and upper 30s. Portions of the North Shore, however, continued to experience combinations of heavy sleet, rain and even freezing rain. Colder air returned late in the day which changed the wintry mix and rain back to snow 3-5 PM. Most of the remaining snow ended by 7 PM, though a few pockets remained until nearly 10 PM as the temperature dropped into the mid and upper 20s. In addition to the precipitation, winds were frequently 15 – 30 miles per hour, with gusts above 40 miles per hour at times.</p>"

With temperatures that remained steady, the snow changed to sleet and pockets of freezing rain from 3-5 AM, which became increasingly heavy towards daybreak. An extensive period of very heavy sleet took place, which amounted to a 2.0-4.0 inch sleet accumulation. With sleet being generally three to four times more dense than snow, this led to an extremely heavy and dense snow/sleet pack relative to the overall accumulation. From 7-10 AM, sleet began to mix with snow once again; however, this mixture lightened and became scattered thru 10 AM-12 PM. In addition, winds increased through the morning and became strong with gusts of 25-35 mph. Any lingering precipitation ended as snow between 3 and 5 PM as the temperature slightly warmed to 27-32 degrees.
