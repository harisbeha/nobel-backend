There should be three classes of users:
- nwa (central admin)
- cbre (regional admin)
- vendor (service provider)
every user should be part of only one of these groups.
cbre and vendor users should be additionally associated with a specific regional admin or provider.
every user is assumed to act on behalf of the entire organization they are part of.

nwa should be able to create, view, and edit the list of regional admins.
cbre should be able to create, view and edit the list of vendors.
any vendor a cbre creates should be associated with that regional admin.
TODO: how are users created?

work orders should have a visible set of yes/no (possibly including an unknown or not-yet-available status) properties
indicating which pieces of information are available and their position in the clerical pipeline:
- Safe - has the property been marked safe to open? (yes/no)
- VisitsDocumented - Has all information about work visits been entered? (yes/no)
- WeatherReady - Has the system produced the spending forecast for the work order? (yes/no)
- Failure - Has cbre marked the service as a failure? (yes/no/unknown)
- HasDiscrepancies - Has nwa marked a discrepancy in the forecasted/actual spending for the work order? (yes/no/unk)
- HasDiscrepanciesFailure - Has the vendor failed to provide a satisfactory response to the discrepancies? (yes/no)
- Completed - Has the work order been sent to the vendor on a finalized invoice? (yes/no)

a vendor should be able to create and modify work orders:
- a vendor should only be able to see work orders they created.
- a vendor should not be able to edit the fields they provided while creating the work order.
- a vendor should be able to add safety reports to any work order not marked Safe.
- if a safety report says that the facility is safe to open, the work order is marked as Safe.
- a vendor should be able to add visit reports to any work order not marked VisitsDocumented.
- a vendor should be able to mark VisitsDocumented on a work order not already marked as such.

as soon as a work order is created, the system should begin computing forecast data for it. when the data is ready,
the system should mark WeatherReady = yes.

cbre should be able to view a list of their work orders.
cbre should be able to mark Failure = yes or Failure = no on any of these.

nwa should be able to view a list of work orders with all of the following:
- WeatherReady = yes
- VisitsDocumented = yes
- Failure = no or unk
- Completed = no
nwa should be able to move one of these work orders through the pipeline:
- nwa should be able to mark a work order as HasDiscrepancies = no
- nwa should be able to mark a work order as HasDiscrepanciesFailure = yes
nwa should be able to add a discrepancy report to any of these work orders:
- this will set HasDiscrepancies = yes
- this will send an email to the vendor

the vendor should be able to view a list of work orders for which HasDiscrepancies = yes and their discrepancy reports
they should be able to add a discrepancy report to any of these work orders:
- this will set HasDiscrepancies = unk
- this will send an email to nwa

there should be some mechanism, either manual on the part of the vendor or automated on a cycle, for creating a new
invoice from a vendor for some or all of the work orders for a vendor without an invoice already attached.

if the system detects that an invoice's jobs all meet all of the following criteria, it will finalize the invoice,
marking each of the work orders as completed, and send it to the vendor and the relevant cbre:
- VisitsDocumented = yes
- Failed != unknown
- one of the following:
  - HasDiscrepancies = no
  - HasDiscrepanciesFailure = yes
